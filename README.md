# Simple-i3
A user friendly i3 setup that I made for family memebers that I decided to share with you!

Dependencies: dmenu, dunst, i3-wm, nitrogen, polybar, rofi, starship, xorg, and termial of your choice.
Optional Dependencies: picom, lightdm, and slick-greeter.

You can download the install script and make it executable or just copy and paste in terminal.

Control+Shift+T is the keybind for the theme switcher (See i3 config).
